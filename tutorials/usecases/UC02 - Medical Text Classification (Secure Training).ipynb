    "Bob <sup>MD</sup> and Alice <sup>MD</sup> are physicians running their respective medical practices and both have a database of private medical transcriptions. You own a Natural Language Processing (NLP) company and have been contacted by these physicians because both Bob <sup>MD</sup> and Alice <sup>MD</sup> have heard of the high quality of the Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) solutions you provide and want you to create a text classifier to help them automatically assign a medical specialty to each new patient text transcription."

    "Healthcare data is highly regulated and should be, for most intents and purposes, private. Therefore, if in a medical setting, the Machine Learning model being trained should not actually look at the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Combining both Bob's and Alice's datasets, you should be able to create a bigger, better dataset that you could use to train your model with higher accuracy, only that you can't because it's all sensitive and private data, which is why you will need [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/pysyft/) and [SyferText](https://github.com/OpenMined/SyferText/) to complete the job at hand."

    "\n",
    "The batches will be composed of training examples coming from both Bob's and Alice's datasets as if it were only one big dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in the batch contains an encrypted version of one transcription's embedding vector and its encrypted label. For this tutorial, the vector will be computed as the average of the transcription's individual token vectors taken from the `en_core_web_lg` language model. Also, tokens with custom tags indicated in `excluded_tokens` won't be taken into account in computing a transcription's vector.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. First, the `Language` object `nlp` is used to preprocess one transcription on Bob's or Alice's machine.\n",
    "2. The object `nlp` determines that the real transcription text is actually remote, so it sends a subpipeline containing the required pipeline components we defined to the corresponding worker.\n",
    "3. The subpipeline is run and a `Doc` object is created on the remote worker containing the transcription's individual tokens appropriately tokenized and tagged.\n",
    "4. On the local worker, a `DocPointer` object is created pointing to that `Doc` object.\n",
    "5. By calling `get_encrypted_vector()` on the `DocPointer`, the call is forwarded to `Doc`, which, in turn, computes the `Doc` vector, encrypts it with Secure Multy-Party Computation (SMPC) using PySyft and returns it to the caller at the local worker.\n",
    "6. The PyTorch dataloader takes this encrypted vector and appends it to the training or validation batch.\n",
