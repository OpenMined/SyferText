   "source": [
    "Suppose you run a deep learning company that provides NLP expertise. You have two clients: Bob and Alice. Each of them runs their own website were users can write reviews about movies that have watched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob and Alice have heard of the great services you provide and asked you to create a sentiment classifier to help them automatically assign a sentiment (positive or negative) to each users review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you think that this is a really good opportunity. If you pool data from both Bob's and Alice's datasets, you would be able to create a bigger dataset that you can use to train a better classifer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But... \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out you are not allowed to do this; both datasets are private.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are informed that privacy regulations in both Bob's and Alice's countries, prevents them from revealing their data to any third party. You cannot move Bob's data to your company's machines. Same for Alice's. Each dataset is contrained to live on its owner's machine, and they cannot be mixed together to create a bigger dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you think about OpenMined, and their great library called PySyft that provides the possiblity to perform Federated Learning and Encrypted Computations. Without that, you will be able to train a single model on both datasets at the same time. and YOUR ARE RIGHT!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "As you new, text datasets cannot be consumed directly for training a neural training. You need to create numerical representations of each text review before PySyft can consume it. Text needs to be tokenized first, preprocessed and vector embedding should be used instead of plaintext. But how to do such preprocessing if you are not allowed to have access to plaintext data? \n",
    "\n",
    "**SyferText** can help you! With SyferText, you can define preprocessing components that you can send over a network to Bob's and Alice's machine to perform preprocessing remotely, blindly and in a completely secure fashion. SyferText components do all the work from processing plaintext to obtaining its vector representation and encrypting it to hand it over to PySyft models for training. All without you accessing the data, and without the data quitting their owners machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are wondering how that works, keep on following this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's summarize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to create a bigger dataset out of Bob's and Alice's smaller datasets. *(PySyft has the arsenal for that)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You need to prepare and preprocess the text data on Bob's and Alice's machines without revealing it, without moving any datasets to your machine, and without the need to work directly on Bob's or Alice's machines. *(SyferText to the rescue)*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we are going to work with the IMDB movie review dataset. This is a public dataset. But we are going to break it into two part, send each part to a differet PySyft work. We  consider that each part is a private dataset owned by the PySyft worker."
