        """Adds a pipe template to the pipeline template.

        A pipe template is a dict of the form `{'remote': remote, 'name': name}`.
        Few main steps are carried out here:

        1- The new pipe name is added at the right position in the pipeline template.
           Here is an example of how pipeline template list looks like

           self.pipeline_template = [{'remote': True,  'name': 'tokenizer'},
                                     {'remote': True,  'name': <pipe_1_name>},
                                     {'remote': False, 'name': <pipe_2_name>},
                                     {'remote': True,  'name': <pipe_3_name>},
                                     {'remote': True,  'name': <pipe_4_name>}]

        2- The pipeline template is parsed into a list of subpipeline templates.
           Each subpipeline template is an aggregation of adjacent pipes with
           the same value for 'remote'.
           Here is an example of how the subpipeline template list for the above
           pipeline template would look like:

           self.subpipeline_templates = [{'remote': True, 'names': ['tokenizer',
                                                                    'pipe_1_name',
                                                                    'pipe_2_name']},
                                         {'remote': False, 'name': ['pipe_3_name']},
                                         {'remote': True,  'name': ['pipe_4_name'
                                                                    'pipe_5_name']}
                                        ]

        3- The pipeline is initialize by creating a list with as many empty dicts as
           there are subpipelines:

           self.pipeline = [dict(), dict()]

                either on a Doc object directly, or on a DocPointer returned by the previous
                component in the pipeline. Defaults to False.

        worker if `input` is remote. Then runs the subpipeline at position
        `template_index` of self.pipeline on the appropriate worker.

        The worker on which the subpipeline is run is either the
        the same worker on which `input` lives, if the `remote`
        property of the subpipeline template is True. Or, it is the
        local worker if `remote` is False.

        The self.pipeline is a list of dicts which stores
        the references to Subpipeline (or SubpipelinePointer) objects.
        It is created by parsing self.subpipeliline_template.

        At each index in self.pipeline we have a dictionary which
        holds the location id as the key and a reference to the
        SubPipeline (or SubpipelinePointer) object as the value.

        The text (or StringPointer) is processed by the tokenizer to create
        Doc (or DocPointer) object which is then processed in place by
        the subpipeline components in the relative order in which
        they are stored in self.pipeline.

        If no subpipeline is yet created for the specified worker,
        one is created using the template in self.subpipeline_templates
        and added to the pipeline.

        Example:
            If a text is to be processed on the local machine, then subpipelines
            in the pipeline are initialized on the local machine.
            So if there are 3 subpipelines in the pipeline then

            self.pipeline = [{'me': SubPipeline[pipe_1_name > pipe_2_name]},
                             {'me': SubPipeline[pipe_3_name]},
                             {'me': SubPipeline[pipe_4_name, pipe_5_name]},
                            ]

            Now any more local texts that are to be processed by the pipeline are
            processed with the subpipeline objects already present on the local machine.

            Then if we pass a StringPointer referring to a text located on a remote
            machine, new SubPipeline objects whose templates in `self.subpipeline_templates`
            has "remote = True" are created on remote machines and their references
            are stored in dictionaries at appropriate indices in `self.pipeline` with
            remote location id as the key.

            Hence in our example, if subpipeline templates at the first and third indices
            in `self.subpipeline_templates` have "remote = True". Then upon passing a
            StringPointer to the pipeline, new subpipeline objects are initialized on
            bob's machine and their references are stored in dictionaries at the first
            and third indices in `self.pipeline` with `bob` as the key.

            self.pipeline = [{'me' : SubPipeline[pipe_1_name > pipe_2_name],
                              'bob': SubPipelinePointer[pipe_1_name > pipe_2_name]},
                             {'me' : SubPipeline[pipe_3_name]},
                             {'bob': SubPipelinePointer[pipe_4_name > pipe_5_name],
                              'me' : SubPipeline[pipe_4_name > pipe_5_name]}

                The order of workers stored in the dictionary in self.pipeline is arbitrary.
